# YouTube Transcript MCP Server Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the YouTube Transcript MCP Server project.

## Documentation Overview

### [Development Process](development-process.md)
Complete development history and technical decisions for building our custom YouTube transcript MCP server. Covers the problem discovery, solution research, implementation approach, and success metrics.

**Key Sections:**
- Background: Why we built a custom server
- Technical Results: Performance vs original broken server  
- Architecture Decisions: Build vs buy analysis
- Lessons Learned: Key insights for future projects

### [Alexandria Integration Plan](alexandria-integration-plan.md) 
Detailed roadmap for integrating the YouTube transcript server with Alexandria knowledge base system post-Mnemosyne overhaul.

**Key Sections:**
- Integration Architecture: Current state → Target state  
- Implementation Phases: 3-phase rollout plan
- Technical Requirements: Plugin interface and storage needs
- Success Metrics: How to measure integration success

## Quick Reference

### Current Status
- ✅ **Functional MCP Server**: Reliably extracts YouTube transcripts
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and testing
- ⏳ **Alexandria Integration**: Waiting for Mnemosyne/Alexandria overhaul

### Key Achievements  
- **Reliable Extraction**: 59,836 characters from Joshua Bloch video (vs 0 from original server)
- **Comprehensive Tools**: `get_transcript` and `list_transcripts` with rich debugging
- **URL Flexibility**: Handles full URLs, short URLs, and direct video IDs
- **Integration Ready**: Structured JSON output designed for knowledge base ingestion

### Next Steps
1. **Wait for Alexandria Overhaul**: Architecture needs to stabilize first
2. **Develop Alexandria Plugin**: Transform transcript data for knowledge base
3. **Implement Timestamp Search**: Enable video segment discovery
4. **Build Curation Pipeline**: Focus on high-quality technical content

## Technical Architecture

### Current Flow
```
YouTube Video → MCP Server → Claude Agent
                    ↓
            JSON transcript data
```

### Target Flow (Post-Alexandria Integration)
```
YouTube Video → MCP Server → Alexandria Plugin → Knowledge Base
                                      ↓
          Agent Queries ← Search Index ← Timestamped Content
```

## Use Cases

### Immediate (Current MCP Server)
- Extract transcripts for manual analysis
- Debug transcript availability issues
- Access video content in text format
- Support multiple URL formats

### Future (Alexandria Integrated)
- **Agent Knowledge**: "What did Joshua Bloch say about API design?"
- **Technical Research**: Search video presentations for specific concepts  
- **Expert Citations**: Reference authoritative video sources with timestamps
- **Curated Learning**: Access high-quality technical presentations through search

## Integration Timeline

| Phase | Scope | Timeline | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Custom MCP Server** | Reliable transcript extraction | ✅ Complete | Production ready |
| **Alexandria Plugin** | Basic transcript ingestion | Post-overhaul | Waiting on architecture |
| **Enhanced Search** | Timestamp-aware search | +2-4 weeks | Design complete |  
| **Curated Pipeline** | Quality scoring & categorization | +1-2 months | Planning phase |

This documentation provides the complete context for understanding the YouTube transcript server's current capabilities and future integration plans with Alexandria.
